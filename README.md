## âœ¨ Project Overview

BajetiBuddy is a mobile budgeting companion that delivers personalized AI-driven 
financial advice tailored specifically for users in Kenya and similar 
developing-country contexts. The app provides intelligent budget optimization, 
expense tracking, and savings recommendations while working seamlessly on 
low-end Android devices with intermittent connectivity.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Deliver contextually relevant budgeting advice for East African financial 
  patterns
- Integrate seamlessly with M-Pesa and mobile money ecosystems
- Provide offline-capable core functionality for users with limited connectivity
- Maintain sub-3-second response times on entry-level Android devices
- Ensure complete user privacy with local-first data processing
- Achieve 70%+ budgeting accuracy through culturally-aware AI recommendations

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Mobile Framework**: Flutter 3.x for cross-platform compatibility
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, deployed on Railway/Render
- **LLM Services**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo with custom fine-tuning for local 
  context
- **Embedding Services**: Sentence Transformers for expense categorization
- **Data Store**: SQLite (local) + PostgreSQL (cloud sync)
- **Payment Integration**: M-Pesa Daraja API, Equity Bank API

## ðŸ”’ Key Constraints

- **Hardware**: Optimized for Android 7+ devices with 2GB RAM minimum
- **Connectivity**: Core features must work offline; sync when available
- **Integration**: M-Pesa transaction import and budget reconciliation required
- **Privacy**: All personal financial data encrypted locally; no cloud PII 
  storage
- **Localization**: Support for English and Swahili languages
- **Performance**: <3s app launch time, <1s navigation between screens

## âœ… Success Criteria

- **Daily Active Users**: 1,000+ within 6 months of launch
- **Budgeting Accuracy**: 70%+ user-reported accuracy on spending predictions
- **Retention**: 40%+ monthly active user retention
- **Performance**: <3s average loading latency for all core features
- **Cost Efficiency**: <$0.10 per user per month in LLM inference costs
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.2+ stars in Google Play Store

## ðŸ¤– Codex Integration

This repository is optimized for AI-assisted development. When working with 
code generation tools:

- Always check `context.json` for current feature flags and system state
- Refer to `plan.md` for the authoritative task list and priorities  
- Update `log.md` with a summary of changes made
- Keep all TODOs synchronized in `plan.md`

For detailed development context and current task status, see the Codex Context 
Header at the top of this file.
