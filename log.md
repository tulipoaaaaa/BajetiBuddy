# BajetiBuddy Development Log

## 2025-06-12
### Added
- Initial project documentation scaffold generated by Perplexity Architect v1.0
- Created comprehensive README.md with project overview, tech stack, and setup 
  instructions
- Established plan.md with milestone timeline and task decomposition structure
- Configured context.json with machine-readable project state for AI development
- Set up development log structure for tracking changes and decisions

### Project Scope Defined
- Target market: Kenya and similar developing-country contexts
- Core value proposition: AI-driven budgeting advice optimized for local 
  financial patterns
- Technical constraints: Low-end Android devices, intermittent connectivity, 
  M-Pesa integration requirements
- Success metrics: 1K+ DAU, 70%+ budgeting accuracy, <$0.10/user/month AI costs

### Architecture Decisions
- **Mobile Framework**: Flutter chosen for cross-platform compatibility and 
  performance on resource-constrained devices
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for rapid development and good ecosystem 
  support
- **AI Strategy**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo with local fine-tuning rather than 
  building models from scratch
- **Data Storage**: Hybrid approach with SQLite for offline capability and 
  PostgreSQL for cloud sync
- **Payment Integration**: M-Pesa Daraja API as primary integration point

### Trade-offs Considered
- **Flutter vs React Native**: Flutter selected for better performance on 
  low-end Android devices and more predictable UI behavior
- **Local vs Cloud AI**: Decided on cloud-based AI with local fallbacks to 
  balance cost, capability, and offline functionality  
- **Real-time vs Batch Sync**: Chose eventual consistency model to handle 
  intermittent connectivity gracefully
- **Monolith vs Microservices**: Starting with monolithic backend for faster 
  initial development, with modularity for future extraction

### Next Actions
- Set up Flutter project structure and initial UI mockups
- Create backend API skeleton with authentication endpoints
- Research M-Pesa Daraja API integration requirements and sandbox setup
- Begin user research with target demographic in Kenya for feature validation
- Establish CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
